OOP Lab Project
This repository contains an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project implemented in Python, created as part of an ITI lab assignment. The project simulates a system with Person, Car, Employee, and Office classes, focusing on an employee's daily routine, including driving to work and managing office interactions.

Features
Person Class: Manages attributes like name, money, mood, and health rate, with methods for sleeping, eating, and buying items.
Car Class: Handles vehicle operations with fuel rate and velocity, including a run method to simulate driving (fuel decreases by 1 unit per km) and a stop method.
Employee Class: Extends Person with attributes like ID, car, email, salary, and distance to work, including methods for working, driving (at 60 km/h), refueling, and sending emails.
Office Class: Manages employees with methods for hiring, firing, rewarding, deducting salary, and checking lateness based on travel time to arrive before 9:00 AM.
